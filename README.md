Video-Landing-Page  - Created by Julian Herr


SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install Node.js
2. Install NPM via CMD Terminal [command: npm install -g npm]
8. Using the command line, run these three commands in order to get the dependancies organized:
[
[npm install axios],
[npm install --save react-router-dom],
[npm install --save react-hls-player --legacy-peer-deps],
[npm install swiper],
[npm install -D tailwindcss]
]

3. Open visual studio code
4. Open VideoLandingPage-main in the editor
5. Open a terminal, type [cd VideoLandingPage-main]
6. Use the command line, type [npm start]
7. This should automatically open up http://localhost:3000/ in your web browser - if not, manually open the URL up.

INSTRUCTIONS TO NAVIGATE APP:

1. When clicking on a showreel item and it redirects you to the browser player - once completed watching please press F5/Refresh. This would be changed via a button etc.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In order to expand the system to millions of users, I would firstly add an authentication system which would allow to have userspecific instances of the App,
Adding this would in turn require us to add security measures to prevent data loss/exploitation - I would also streamline the efficiency of the data extraction from the end points in order to reduce resources required to do so - whether this be by making better functions to call the information.
And making it more modular to allow for one/two function to do the bread and butter work and just input variables such as data links etc. This will reduce repeated code.
Logging on each page would be necessary to be able to see more effectively where and why the code is breaking down at specific points of interest.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
